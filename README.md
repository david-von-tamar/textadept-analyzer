# Static Analysis for Textadept
This module integrates static analyzers in [Textadept](https://github.com/orbitalquark/textadept). Currently, the module integrates [luacheck](https://github.com/mpeterv/luacheck) with annotations and indicators (squiggle markers) for errors and warnings within the code editor. The module calls the static analyzer each time when a file is saved. You can integrate additional static analyzers with this module by following the luacheck example. The module takes the responsbility of displaying the errors and warnings within the editor itself; however, your submodule is expected to: (a) provide the shell command with all the options and arguments; (b) parse the output of the static analyzer; and (c) sort the results into errors and warnings (see how all of this is done with the luacheck example).
